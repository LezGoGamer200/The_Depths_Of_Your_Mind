          Tips & Tricks! <br />
          An important part of any gaming website, & I have a few to share with
          you! The first being, you can find only one of each weapon, & once you
          find one, you can't find one anywhere else in the whole world of
          Dragons & Daydreaming. You can use this tid bit of information to find
          every other weapon in the game, except for the Legendary Dream Cleaver
          on dark peak mountain. Then go to dark peak, & the only weapon you can
          find there is the Dream Cleaver, therefore, if you get then weapon
          chance while searching, it is garunteed to be the Dream Cleaver. My
          second tip is to remember to sleep, & play some mini-games. They both
          heal you back to full health, & sleeping has some fun "cutscenes" for
          you to watch/read. That is all for now, have fun!
